## Algorithms
The project currently supports the following maze generation algorithms:

1. Depth-First Search (DFS): A recursive algorithm that generates a maze by exploring each path to its end before backtracking.
2. Breadth-First Search (BFS): An algorithm that explores all possible paths level by level.
3. Prim's Algorithm: A randomized algorithm that builds a maze by adding edges to a growing spanning tree.
